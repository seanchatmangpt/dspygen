# rdddy

Reactive DDD framework with DSPy

## Using

_Python package_: to add and install this package as a dependency of your project, run `poetry add rdddy`.

_Python CLI_: to view this app's CLI commands once it's installed, run `rdddy --help`.

_Python application_: to serve this REST API, run `docker compose up app` and open [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser. Within the Dev Container, this is equivalent to running `poe api`.
